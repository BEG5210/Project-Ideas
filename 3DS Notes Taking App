The 3ds offers a unique way of writing with the stylus.
along with its camera, 3d screen, and stylus touch screen, the 3ds could be used as a great tool for note taking, weather its over sertain parts of a video, asociated with a photo, for just jotting things down, and more!
i think it would be a cool idea to make a purpose-built, open source productive note-taking app!


Possible Features:
1. Taking notes over video
2. Taking notes
3. Taking notes over photo
4. Intergration with google drive? - No fucking idea how i would even begin to do that, but its an idea!
